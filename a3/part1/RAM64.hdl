/**
 * RAM64: Memory of 64 registers, each 16 bits wide.  
 * The chip supports read and write operations, as follows:
 *     Read:  out(t) = RAM64[address(t)](t)
 *     Write: If load(t-1)==1 then RAM64[address(t-1)](t) = in(t-1)
 * In words: the chip always outputs the value stored at the memory 
 * location specified by 'address'. If load==1, the in value is loaded 
 * into the memory location specified by address.  This value becomes 
 * available through the out pin starting from the next time step.
